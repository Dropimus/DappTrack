Read on so you can actually understand why many people are so bullish.\n\nThere are 4 key components powering the Humanity Protocol.¬†\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£VC: Verified Credentials are digital certificates issued on the blockchain that confirm a user's human status or any form of credential tied to their identity.\n\nExamples:¬†\n\nüîπÔ∏èProof that you're a human, not a bot\nüîπÔ∏èKYC credentials\nüîπÔ∏èEmployment history\nüîπÔ∏èEducation credentials.¬†\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£Identity Validators: Selected, trustworthy entities that validate the private data submitted by users.¬†\n\nüîπThey must stake $HP tokens as part of the process to ensure the integrity and security of the system.\n\nüîπThey also issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs).¬†\n\nüîπWhen a user submits their private data, they check to confirm if the data submitted is genuinely valid. If it is, they issue a VC.¬†\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£Next up, the ZK Proofers (or verifier Nodes): These are nodes that cryptographically verify the validity of the VCs¬† issued by identity validators.¬†\n\nüîπHow? They receive and verify the correctness of a Zero Knowledge Proof for the VC associated with a Human ID.¬†\n\nüîπThey also receive $HP tokens as compensation.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ZKProof: In Zero-Knowledge cryptography, a statement can be proven as truthful without revealing any specific information about the statement or knowledge itself.¬†\n\nSo rest assured. When you submit your data on Humanity,¬† the ZK proofers can verify its valid without having access to any underlying user data. Humanity guarantees that personal information remains fully confidential.\n\nüí†We're still in Phase 1, Humanity Protocol currently serves as the sole Identity Validator.\n\nIn Phase 2, a broad set of Identity Validators will be added to the Protocol.¬†\n\nüè®Think accredited universities, large companies, etc. They will be able to issue VCs in their respective domains.\n\nIn my next post, i will be sharing some Invites code for you to verify yourself..! On notifications and engage..!\n\nGHuman.üíé",

Turn events into seamless Proof of Humanity (PoH) checkpoints, enhancing security & verification.\n\n2). Leverage Moongate's partnerships with major Web3 entities like Binance, potentially expanding its user base.\n\n3). Combine technologies to accelerate the adoption of decentralized identity in real-world scenarios.\n\n4). Access new revenue streams through Moongate's business model, strengthening market presence.\n\n5). Scalability & Privacy, With Moongate's established user base & infrastructure, Humanity Protocol can scale its technology to reach more users globally. \n\n6). Enhanced User Engagement & Loyalty, Moongate's attention asset protocol is designed to create on-chain achievements & rewards, such as NFTs & smart tokens, which enhance user engagement. \n\n-Those who followed my thread on Moongate's last year Mint an NFT.\n\n7). Mitigation of Sybil Attacks & Bots, Decentralized systems often face challenges from bots & fake accounts, known as Sybil attacks. Humanity Protocol's Proof of Humanity consensus mechanism, combined with Moongate's real-world event infrastructure, helps ensure that only real humans can participate in certain activities.\n\nThe acquisition of Moongate by Humanity Protocol has a lot more benefits which I can't mention in one Tweet..! \n\nIt positions them to lead in integrating decentralized identity with real-world applications.\n\nBy leveraging Moongate's infrastructure, Humanity Protocol can enhance user engagement, scale its technology, & ensure privacy-preserving identity verification, while also mitigating bots & expanding its market presence. \n\nThis is honestly a very big move by @Humanityprot team..!\n\nPrevious thread about Moongate.? \nhttps://t.co/TkhjY712HF",

There are two reasons we held off on announcing them from the start:\n\n1. We plan to offer better rewards for believers, but we also want to give long-term contributors an added advantage.\n\n2. We‚Äôre excited to welcome new users into the Mitosis ecosystem, and we want them to join with a clear understanding of the rewards.\n\nSo, to keep it simple, you probably have two big questions:\nWill the rewards be valuable? Most likely, yes.\nIs it too late to join? Not at all. there‚Äôs still plenty of time to get involved.\n\nI‚Äôll share full details next week.\n\ngMITO",

We've interacted with this project before to position ourselves for the potential airdrop.\n\nNow, we can yap about it and earn a share of the rewards pool just by discussing it.\n\nI won't discuss many projects because if you have a small number of followers, you should focus on 1-3 projects. Try not to catch all the fish.\n\nConcentrate on these projects, talk about them, and try to accumulate as much mindshare as you can.\n\nThat's all for now.

Focus on the mindshare you earn.\n\nCreate 1-3 engaging long-form posts to attract attention. Mindshare will eventually lead to Yap points.\n\nThat's all for now.",

That's an increase of 3.55% in a day, 4.49% in a week, and 44.19% over the month. This shows solid growth, even as the market has been choppy.\n\n@mETHProtocol expanded to HyperEVM in March 2025, marking a significant shift. You can deposit $cmETH into the HyperETH Vault on @0xHyperBeat and access over 10 types of yields, including staking, restaking rewards, and Powder points.\n\nCurrently, more than 57% of the vault's $6M+ TVL is in $cmETH. Enhance your earnings by providing liquidity to the $cmETH/uETH pool on @HyperSwapX to earn 20x Powder and HyperSwap points.\n\nAdditionally, you can use $cmETH as collateral on @HypurrFi to borrow $UETH and collect more points.\n\nThis route will also be used to interact with @HyperliquidX's future airdrop.\n\nRecently, @Bybit_Official launched their 3rd Mega Drop featuring $mETH. You can stake $BTC or $USDT to earn from a 2M $mETH pool, 50K for Launchpool and 1.95M for Super Drop.\n\nIt's live now, and with Bybit's scale, this could bring more attention to the mETH ecosystem.\n\nIf you're aiming to farm differently, @mETHProtocol's integration with Pendle offers 5x points for $mETH and $cmETH positions.\n\nFor now, until the market improves, I'm staking some $mETH to earn 5x points. I've also staked some USDT on Bybit to earn from a 2M $mETH pool.\n\nIt's an easy way to accumulate rewards while the market stabilizes. \n\nThat's all for now, will keep you in the loop",

I'm here to back anyone keen on joining the action.\n\nGet all the scoop on @stayloudio!\n\nIt is a Kaito SocialFi which is already dominating, securing the top spot on the Kaito leaderboard, where users earn weekly rewards based on their mindshare contributions.\n\nBasically to gain mindshare, tweet about @stayloudio and interact with others discussing them. The more mindshare you earn, the higher your score on the leaderboard, leading to potential rewards.\n\nThe buzz is about their Initial Attention offering, which is exciting if you can participate.\n\nThey're launching their own token, $LOUD, with a total supply of 1 billion. Of this, 450 million are available for token supply, another 450 million are allocated for liquidity provision, and 100 million are for community initiatives.\n\nThis is one of the best tokenomics I've seen in a while.\n\nToken sales will occur in two phases.\n\nPhase 1 offers a guaranteed allocation, where the top 1,000 $LOUD yappers are eligible to participate.\n\nEach participant can acquire tokens worth 0.2 $SOL.\n\nPhase 2 will operate on a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) basis, with each wallet contributing the same amount. There are 120k whitelisted wallets.\n\nThe token sale is scheduled for May 31st, and a snapshot will be taken before the sale for the whitelist (WL).\n\nAll funds raised will be added to the liquidity pool (LP), along with an additional 450 million $LOUD tokens, which is remarkable.\n\nTo join @stayloudio, you need a minimum of 10+ smart followers.\n\nVisit https://t.co/sBZ2Zn3s2l, log in with X, and link your Solana wallet.\n\nStart posting about them to climb the leaderboard.\n\nNote: Avoid spamming...\n\nWill help a few of you meet the minimum requirement, so engage with it.\n\nThat's all for now, keep yapping.",
