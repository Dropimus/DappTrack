# **Dropimus**

*The Trust Layer for Web3 Airdrops*


---

## **Overview**

Dropimus is building the infrastructure to restore trust in the **\$10B+ Web3 airdrop economy**. Over **\$2B was lost to scam airdrops in 2024**, and the problem is growing. Dropimus provides:

* **Multi-chain airdrop tracking** (EVM, Solana, and more)
* **AI-driven fraud detection** (Proof of Integrity)
* **Proof of Person** for Sybil resistance
* **Airdrop Derivative Market (ADM)** for trading speculative positions on upcoming airdrops

---

## **Vision**

To make airdrops transparent, secure, and financialized, creating an ecosystem where **incentives drive growth—not scams**.

---

## **Architecture**

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Frontend:** React Native (UI in progress), Flet MVP for demo
* **AI Layer:** Placeholder structure for fraud detection models
* **Scripts:** Data scrapers for airdrop aggregation
* **Smart Contracts:** Proof of Integrity & ADM logic (future on-chain implementation)
* **Containerization:** Docker for services
